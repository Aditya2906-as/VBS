📌 Project Title

Virtual Banking System (VBS)

📌 Overview / Short Description

The Virtual Banking System (VBS) is a full-stack web application that simulates core banking operations. It allows users to interact with virtual bank accounts through a responsive UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the secure backend is developed with Java and Spring Boot. The application stores and manages all data using a MySQL database.

This system demonstrates how real-world online banking platforms work by integrating frontend and backend technologies to handle data storage, business logic, and user interactions.

🧠 Key Features

You can include the following features (customize based on what your code actually implements):

✔ User registration and login (authentication)
✔ Account creation and management
✔ View account details and balance
✔ Deposit and withdraw funds
✔ Transfer funds between accounts
✔ Transaction history display
✔ Input validation and error handling
✔ Responsive frontend interface
✔ REST API backend with Spring Boot
✔ Relational database design with MySQL

(Add or modify this list based on your exact code features.)

🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript

Backend:
• Java
• Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA)

Database:
• MySQL

Tools & Build:
• Maven (build tool)

Other:
• Git / GitHub for version control

(This stack highlights skills recruiters often look for in full-stack developers.)

🚀 How It Works (Conceptual Flow)

Frontend collects user requests and displays results.

Backend (Spring Boot) receives HTTP requests via REST endpoints, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.

MySQL database stores user accounts and transaction data.

Responses are sent back to the frontend to update the UI dynamically using JavaScript.
